Economic Fracture Mechanics: A Scientific Framework Mathematical Foundation and Empirical Validation for Economic System Analysis by Scott Corwon, IMPACTS Research &amp; Development
Abstract
This paper presents the first mathematically rigorous translation of fracture mechanics principles from materials science to economic system analysis. Building upon foundational work in econophysics (Mantegna & Stanley, 1999), financial contagion theory (Allen & Gale, 2000), and complexity economics (Arthur, 2015), I develop a dimensionally consistent Economic Fracture Mechanics (EFM) framework with complete stochastic specification and comprehensive empirical validation. My approach provides quantitative tools for predicting economic failures, measuring systemic risk, and designing resilient financial architectures. The framework demonstrates 84.7% accuracy in failure prediction with complete reproducibility.
